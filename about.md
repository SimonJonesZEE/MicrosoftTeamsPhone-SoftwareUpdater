## Overview
Shared Calling greater simplifies and accelerates the deployment of Teams Phone. A shared phone number is used and applied to multiple Teams Phone users via a single policy configuration.

## Benefits
* Quick and easy to deploy.
* Makes the most of your Teams Phone licensing as part of E5 or standalone.
* Risk free as existing telephony can see be used in parallel.
* Works with all PSTN connectivity options.
* Existing telephone numbers can be consolidated or migrated later (backfilled) as part of a wider telephony transformation strategy. 
* Can be combined as part of a cost reduction. i.e. not removing telephony access for low and no usage telephony users.

## How it works
Instead of assigning a phone number to every user, you use the phone number of a resource account associated with an Auto attendant for inbound and outbound PSTN calls. The Shared Calling policy configures the resource account used for outbound calls and emergency numbers that are used as emergency callback numbers.
