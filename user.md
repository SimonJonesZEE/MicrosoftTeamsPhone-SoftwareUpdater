## 3. Options

* **1. Archive** <br/> This will create a compressed ZIP archive from specified files in the 'tmp' and 'logs' directories and places the ZIP file in the 'arc' directory.

* **4. Update software** <br/> This will schedule software updates on devices based on the results of the file analysis.
