## 4. Options

* **1. Archive** <br/> This will create a compressed ZIP archive from specified files in the 'tmp' and 'logs' directories and places the ZIP file in the 'arc' directory.
> [!TIP]
> This is useful if you want to archive the session files before exiting or selecting a new file.

* **2. Clear debug** <br/> This will clear the contents of the 'debug.txt' located in the 'logs' directory.
> [!NOTE]
> The debug.txt file is only generated if an exception occurs.
  
* **3. Select file** <br/> This will default to the 'data' directory when selecting a text file; alternatively,Â you can browse elsewhere using the file explorer.

* **4. Analyze file** <br/> This will perform an analysis of the selected text file, which contains one or more TeamworkDeviceIds.

* **5. Update software** <br/> This will schedule software updates on devices if applicable.
> [!NOTE]
> This option will only work if the file analysis detects one or more devices requiring updates.

* **6. Restart** <br/> This will initiate a restart of all TeamworkDeviceIds within the selected text file.

* **7. Quit** <br/> This will close and exit the PowerShell GUI removing any session files contained within the 'tmp' and 'logs' directories.
> [!TIP]
> Remember to archive before exiting the application if you want an audit trail of the previous updates.

## 5. How-to
**Step 1:** Once authenticated to start using the Microsoft Teams Phone Software Updater, we must first select a text file that contains one or more TeamworkDeviceIds by selecting option **3. Select file**.<br/>

You will then be prompted for user input.<br/>
   
         Are you sure you want to load a new file? [Y] Yes [N] No: Y
   
> [!NOTE]
> Inputting [N] No or left blank will return you back to the main menu.
   
        Enter a site name or code: LDNOffice.
        
> [!NOTE]
> Please omit the use of spaces in the site name or code.<br/>

Then navigate and select the text file you want to use.<br/>

Then **Press [C] to continue:**

The site name or code (LDNOFFICE) and the selected file (devices.txt) will appear as a visual and functional representation of the current session.<br/>

**Step 2:** The next thing is to analyse the selected text file by using option **4. Analyze file**, this will verify each TeamworkDeviceId to see if there any updates required.
The main updates this app verifies are:<br/>
- [ ] Teams admin agent
- [x] Firmware
- [x] Company portal app
- [ ] Oem agent app
- [x] Teams app
